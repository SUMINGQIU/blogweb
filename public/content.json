Firstly, we built a true-to-real-world environment in Unreal Engine (UE4), as shown in the first picture, which reduced the cost to do the real physical experiments. Then I implement a deep-learning-based depth-map algorithm (Monodepth2) and segmentation algorithm(Detectron2) in the virtual environment. These two methods will generate the 3D occlusion identification and map it into the Unreal Engine virtual environment. Furthermore, we used RRT algorithms for the 2d path planning (Fig 2). We set the starting point (X) and a target point (O). The red line is the optimal path and the green line is all possible paths (Fig 3). After getting the optimal path from above, we change the path into spline in UE4. The planned path in Fig 3 is executed by the virtual agent in Fig 4. In the last step, we designed a spline-based autonomous moving method for agents using a blueprint that also could record real-time position data in TXT format. The recorded position data will be used for the drone to track. This technology can be used for future autonomous driving as drones can assist the car in driving and path planning."},{"title":"Gallery","date":"2023-06-23T19:23:04.000Z","comments":false,"path":"gallery/index.html","permalink":"http://example.com/gallery/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"tags","date":"2023-06-22T04:13:40.000Z","comments":false,"path":"tags/index.html","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""}],"posts":[{"title":"","slug":"test-page","date":"2022-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/01/01/test-page/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/01/01/test-page/","excerpt":"","text":"Hi! Nice to meet you. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon Robotics. I received Master of Science degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence with a Minor in Computer Science at Cornell University. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics with a minor in Applied Mathematics from Lanzhou University. My past research interests cover friction, FEA, and mechanical designs. Now I am working on human-robot collaboration in virtual environment. I am very passionate about interdisciplinary things empowered by physics, computer science, and math. Combining these together and making more productive things attract me a lot. In many of my projects, you can see how I combine different knowledge together. In the future, I wish to explore interesting interdisciplinary in greater depth.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"","slug":"skills-stacks","date":"2022-01-01T16:00:00.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/01/01/skills-stacks/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/01/01/skills-stacks/","excerpt":"","text":"My Skills Languages:Python, Java, Golang, C&#x2F;C++, JavaScript, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, MATLAB, Fortran Software &amp; Frameworks:Node.js, React.js, Tensor Flow, PyTorch, Spring Security, Spring Boot, MySQL, NumPy, Git , Linux, Django, AWS, Azure, AR&#x2F;VR, ROS, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Uneral Engine, Unity, Solid Works, NX, ABAQUS, ANSYS","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"","slug":"workExp","date":"2022-01-01T14:00:00.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/01/01/workExp/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/01/01/workExp/","excerpt":"","text":"Work Experiene AI-Enabled Tactical Route Planning with Real-Time Human-Robot Collaborations --- Lockheed Martin --- Student Researcher Technology Used: ROS, PyTorch, Tensor Flow, Mono Depth, Neural Network, Res-Net, Linux, DFS, Fusion Algorithm, AR/VR Date: 09/2021 - 12/2022 Built a true-to-real-world environment in Unreal Engine (UE4) with drones and cameras, which reduced the cost of doing physical experiments.
