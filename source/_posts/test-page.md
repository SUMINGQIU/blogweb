Hi! Nice to meet you. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Lanzhou University. I am now pursuing my Master of Science degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science at Cornell University. I have held seven pieces of research programs in my undergraduate years and also published three papers. My research interests cover friction, FEA, and mechanical designs. Now I am working on computer vision and Unreal Engines. I am very passionate about interdisciplinary things empowered by physics, computer science, and math. Combining these together and making more productive things attract me a lot. In many of my projects, you can see how I combine different knowledge together. In the future, I wish to explore interesting interdisciplinary in greater depth.
