Hi! Nice to meet you. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon Robotics. I received Master of Science degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence with a Minor in Computer Science at Cornell University. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics with a minor in Applied Mathematics from Lanzhou University.

My past research interests cover friction, FEA, and mechanical designs. Now I am working on human-robot collaboration in virtual environment. I am very passionate about interdisciplinary things empowered by physics, computer science, and math. Combining these together and making more productive things attract me a lot. In many of my projects, you can see how I combine different knowledge together. In the future, I wish to explore interesting interdisciplinary in greater depth.
